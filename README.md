# Java Basics Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of projects I developed to learn and practice the fundamentals of Java programming. Each project focuses on a specific concept or feature of the Java language, showcasing my journey in mastering its basics.

## Features

- **Hands-On Learning**: Practical implementation of Java concepts through small projects.
- **Core Topics**: Covers essential topics such as:
  - Variables and Data Types
  - Control Structures (loops, conditionals)
  - Object-Oriented Programming (classes, objects, inheritance)
  - Exception Handling
  - Basic Input/Output

## Projects
   
1. **Calculator**  
   A simple calculator to demonstrate arithmetic operations and user input.

2. **Number Guessing Game**  
  A game where the program randomly selects a number, and the user has
  to guess it. This project helped me understand loops and conditional statements.

3. **Unit Converter**
  A simple unit convert that can convert between different units of measurement (Celsius, Fahrenheit and Kelvin).
  This project helped me strengthen my understanding of functions and user input.

4. **Password Generator**
   A password generator that creates random password based on user criteria. This project helped me with String handling.

5. **Word Counter**
   A program the count characters, words and line in a file. This project helped me with file manipulation.

6. **To-Do List**
   A application where users can add, list and mark as complete tasks. This project helped me with lists and user input.

7. **Simple Quiz**
   A quiz with multiple choice questions and provides feedback on their answers. This project helped me with lists, conditionals and user input.

8. **Contact Book**
   A application to save, list and delete contacts. this project helped me with data structures and logic.

## Requirements

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Version 8 or later.
- **IDE or Text Editor**: IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or any text editor with Java support.
